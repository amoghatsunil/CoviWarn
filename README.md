# Social Distance Detector


The Social Distancing Detector (aka SDD) is a computer-vision based application that analyzes video feeds to detect whether individuals are appropriately social distancing from each other. This software was developed for the Miami-Dade Beacon Council's 1MPACT initiative by [Strata.ai](https://www.strata.ai/) to assist with business reopening in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. 

This softare was developed to be open-source and free for all Miami-Dade (and beyond) Businesses to use in their retail locations, public spaces, and/or primarily any high-foot-trafficked areas.
